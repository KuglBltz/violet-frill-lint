# Hello Github!

This is a basic HTML starter project that I and some of my friends thought we should tackle. This is more so a love letter to [TitaniumNetwork](https://github.com/titaniumnetwork-dev) than a stand alone website.

## What's in this project?

 

 - `webpage/`: This is the main webpage where everything is hosted and its the frontend part of the website while having some backend

- `information.md`: This contains helpful starter tips on HTML.

- `LICENSE`: WIP
 
- `README.md`: That's this file, what else would it be?

Open each file and check out the comments (in gray) for more info.
